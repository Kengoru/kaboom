                I'm {moment().diff("2004-03-18", "years")} years old and I'm from Germany.
                <br/>
                I made this website to <B>bring people together.</B>
                <br/>
                <div className="mt-2"></div>
                But my dream is to become a youth pastor!
                <br />
                Why, you might ask?
                <br />
                <B>Because Jesus Christ has changed me:</B>
                <br/>
                <div className="mt-2"></div>
                I went from being someone who got <B>lost in seeking love and attention</B> from people and things that don't give any of that, to someone who's now filled with love and has direction.
                <br/>
                <div className="mt-2"></div>
                I went from being someone with a lot of burden from everything that I did wrong, to someone who can now stand and say that <B>I've been forgiven!</B>
                <br/>
                <div className="mt-2"></div>
                <B>My sins are forgiven in an act of grace on the cross</B>, because even though I deserved to be hung on that cross, he gave himself so I wouldn't have to suffer. 
                <br/>
                <div className="mt-2"></div>
                My advice for everyone who feels the same as I did: Give yourself to Jesus Christ and receive <B className="font-extrabold text-yellow-300">LIFE!</B>
                <br/>
                <div className="mt-4"></div>
                Also, thank you for coming to my site. Glad you're here!
